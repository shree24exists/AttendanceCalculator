# Attendance Calculator

A simple attendance calculator made using arrays,if else functions, file operations and for loops.

This project was made specifically for my college assignment, it can calculate attendance for 64 students for 4 Lectures a day, Total 20 lectures a week.

Very simple to use, only requirement is creating a text file named "attendance_data" which will be storing the data after intial run of the code.

will try hosting this as an application or website soon.
